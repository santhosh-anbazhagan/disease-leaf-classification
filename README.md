# Disease Leaf Classification Using CNN  

This project focuses on identifying plant leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model. It provides an efficient and scalable solution for early disease detection, aiding farmers and agricultural experts in timely interventions.  

## Features  
- **Deep Learning Model**:  
  - Designed and trained a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.  
  - Achieved high accuracy in classifying healthy and diseased leaves.  

- **FastAPI for Predictions**:  
  - Developed a FastAPI service for real-time predictions.  
  - Users can upload leaf images and receive instant classification results.  

- **Docker Deployment**:  
  - Deployed the application using Docker for small-scale setups.  
  - Ensures portability and a consistent runtime environment.  

- **Large-Scale Deployment on GCP**:  
  - Hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability.  
  - Utilized Google Cloud Functions for serverless execution.  
  - Integrated Cloud Storage for managing input images and results.  

## Technologies Used
